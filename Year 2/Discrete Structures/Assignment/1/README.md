# Number of Regions

A program which computes the number of regions in a planar graph, when the planar graph is represented using adjacency list.

## Solution: 

I have used Python programming language to solve the above given question, as it provides a huge variety of data structures to work upon. Any given graph could have N properties to itself (planarity, adjacency, etc.) and hence working with Python helps us analyze all its properties and variables easily. I have used the data structure “Lists” for my source code because of its simplicity and its ability to handle data in the form of grouped data like what we have with the given question, i.e., adjacency list. 
I have documented the source code at a few places to better understand the code written.
As the question asks us to use input and output files, I have used them in the source code in such a way that the user could enter the adjacency list of a graph in “aq54ip-2019A7PS0233U.txt”, run the source code, and get the output in “aq54op-2019A7PS0233U.txt”.

There are multiple real-life applications to the given program and solution. A few of them are:

•	Social Graphs: 
This is the best example of real-life applications of this program, in this age of technology. Social graphs by definition are graphs which draws edges between a user and the people, places and things the user has interacted with online. Although this might seem quite a simple thing to do, it plays a major role in our lives and is very complex in nature. 
In a social graph, entries such as Users, Pages, Places, Groups, Comments, Photos, Photo Albums, Videos, Notes, Events, or anything that has properties that store data is considered to be a node or vertex in that graph. Entries such as a User posting a photo, Video or Comment, etc., a User updating their profile with their Place of birth, a relationship status Users, a User liking a Friend's Photo etc., are considered to be connection or edge in that graph.
A social graph could be put to into many uses as this allows large amounts of data of individuals to stored in such a way that could be easily understood and analyzed to solve everyday issues.

•	Knowledge Graphs:
Knowledge Graphs is a concept that has come about in these couple of years, as knowledge of anything and everything could be acquired anywhere and everywhere. The most notable one is that of Google’s Knowledge Graph where they have devised a technique to correlate and create connections among objects/information of the real world, where the object could be anything from a book, a movie, or even an IPL team. The object is ‘connected’ to other closely related objects, such as like the top scorer of a particular IPL team or information about that team’s owner and so on. This allows to use collective human wisdom to gain broader knowledge of anything, for the betterment of the future of mankind.

•	Path Optimization Algorithms:
These algorithms are occupied with finding the best connection that fits some predefined criteria e.g. speed, safety, fuel etc. or set of criteria e.g. procedures, routes. Breadth First Search (BFS) or Depth First Search (DFS) could be used to find a minimum spanning tree and this could be used to optimize the results for any path. Dijkstra’s Algorithm is also a shortest path greedy algorithm used in the field of path optimization. Although the uses of finding the shortest path between two nodes may seem very minimal, it is not so in the real world. 
Path Optimization has been used and not limited to Flight Networks, where efficient route optimizations done to calculate the shortest path to a destination with the shortest fuel usage. 
GPS Navigations are pretty much the most obvious applications we could have with Path Optimization where we could calculate the shortest path to a destination with the least amount of time. 
These algorithms could even be used to scientific computations to calculate the objects of the Quantum scale and also in the Cosmic scale of this vast and expanding universe.
