# Cosets

A program which computes the right cosets of a set H with a set of integers Z (additively).

## Solution:

I have used Python programming language to solve the above given question, as it provides a huge variety of data structures to work upon. As we are dealing with sets in this question, the use of the data structure “Lists” will help us solve the question much easily. 

I have documented the source code at a few places to better understand the code written.

As the question asks us to use input and output files, I have used them in the source code in such a way that the user could enter the adjacency list of a graph in “aq54ip-2019A7PS0233U.txt”, run the source code, and get the output in “aq54op-2019A7PS0233U.txt”.

A Coset is subset of mathematical group consisting of all the products obtained by multiplying (or adding) a fixed element of group by each of elements of given subgroup, either on right or on left. Cosets are basic tool in study of groups.
Some of the applications of cosets are:

•	Computational Group Theory:

Cosets play a very important role in Computational Group Theory. In Mathematics, Computational Group Theory is the study of groups by means of computers. It is concerned with designing and analyzing algorithms and data structures to compute information about groups. The subject has attracted interest because for many interesting groups it is impractical to perform calculations by hand.

An amazing example of this would be the “Thistlethwaite's algorithm”, an algorithm which is devised to solve Rubik’s Cube, relies heavily on cosets.

•	Vitali Set:

In mathematics, a Vitali set, a non-measurable set, is an elementary example of a set of real numbers that is not Lebesgue measurable, found by Giuseppe Vitali in 1905. Lebesgue measurable is the standard way of assigning a measure to subsets of n-dimensional Euclidean space.

•	Transfer:

In the mathematical field of group theory, the transfer defines, given a group G and a subgroup of finite index H, a group homomorphism from G to the abelianization of H. It can be used in conjunction with the Sylow theorems to obtain certain numerical results on the existence of finite simple groups.

The use of cosets plays a very central role in the concept of “Transfer” in Mathematics.
